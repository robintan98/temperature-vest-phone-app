Temperature Vest/iPhone App
M&T Summer Institute Final Project
Date: July 2017
==========================================================
=: Description:
  The software files I coded that interfaced temperature sensors and Peltier junctions with an iPhone app through an Arduino Uno. I wrote the     code that interfaced the sensors/devices with the Arduino in Arduino C. Furthermore, I wrote the code that interfaced the sensor data with     the iPhone app in the Java-based Processing language.
  
=: Context:
  This was my team's final project for the Management & Technology Summer Institute, a rigorous summer program I attended as a rising high       school senior. My team created a minimum viable product of a self-heating and self-cooling wearable vest using a temperature sensor and a       Peltier device. I was my team's technical lead and was responsible for architecting the software and hardware of the product. Our product won   the People's Choice award at the end of the program.
